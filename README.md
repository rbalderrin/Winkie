Winkie - Emergency Data Picker
==============================

Problem

When the rains are intense in the region, disastrous floods occur which cause significant material losses and the evacuation of hundreds of families living in risk areas. The emergency situation is worst when these families have members with mental or physical disabilities, chronic health problems, pregnant women, newborns, or elderly people who need special help at the moment of the evacuation.
It’s a very stressful experience for the evacuated families; generally they don’t have electricity nor communication services and don’t want to leave their houses until the last moment. So it is important for them to know they are always communicated.
In addition, nowadays assistance centers cannot obtain this information systematically which cause inefficient emergency attention. In many cases, these types of disasters are predictable, so it is possible to have updated information of the families that could be affected.
 
Project

Our project aims to help those families with these special vulnerabilities to be always connected with the assistance services, who will know in advance the rank of urgency, what special attention they need to consider before an evacuation, what type of protocol they have to follow, where to accommodate the evacuees and in what conditions they must be evacuated.

We would use Sigfox technology, a reliable, low-power solution to connect sensors and devices, which provides a global connectivity solution, based on an infrastructure of antennas and base stations totally independent of existing networks. Our project is to create a communication platform in which, people will have an IOT device in their homes, which will allow them to send information about their situation or urgent needs to a central application, which will receive the messages, decodes them and send requests and information to the relevant destinations (Hospitals, Civil Society Organizations, State Organizations, Police, Firefighters, Contact Family, etc.).

Value Proposition

We propose a service to communicate alerts and provide information in emergency situations like floods which works through a system of autonomous communication, independent of electricity and internet.

•	Simple and quick way to connect in real time the affected families with the assistance centers or relatives.
•	Provides useful, geo-referenced information to facilitate the organization of the evacuation process.
•	User friendly device, easy to operate and install.
•	Configurable according to the house and family situation.
•	It does not depend on any energy source or conventional communication networks to function.
•	Offers recommendations and action protocols to assistance services and family members about how to proceed with the specific situation.
•	Take care of the evacuated family's home, sending periodical message with temperature and humidity level, with the option of generating alerts of another relevant activity such as intrusions.
•	It will have the option to add data about evacuees conditions and return home processes.
•	Database for future analysis on similar events.
•	Solution with high scalability for other regions and types of disasters.

We have been working in the interaction with the IOT device, generating alerts and storing data in CloudAnt and DB2. We also decide to develop a mobile app to simulate the device with the same communication options. We are working now in the data analysis for the main application.

We believe our project has high scalability not only for other regions but also in another natural disasters.
